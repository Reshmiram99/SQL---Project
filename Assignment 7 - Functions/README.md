Objective

This assignment demonstrates the use of Functions in SQL.

Define Functions in SQL:

In SQL, functions are used to encapsulate reusable logic that performs a specific task. Functions can be of two types:

  - Scalar Functions: Return a single value.

  - Table-Valued Functions: Return a table.

Assignment Instructions:

Consider the Country table and Persons table that you created earlier. Perform the following tasks:

  1. Add a new column called DOB (Date of Birth) in the Persons table with the data type as DATE.
  2. Write a user-defined function to calculate the age of a person using their DOB.
  3. Write a SELECT query to fetch the age of all persons using the function you created.
  4.  For the Country table:

  - Find the length of each country's name.
  - Extract the first three characters of each country's name.
  - Convert all country names to uppercase and lowercase.
