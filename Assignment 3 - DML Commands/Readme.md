# 3 - DML Commands Using to Create Manager Database

Objective

This project demonstrates the use of Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations applied to a table named Managers. The Managers table stores information about managers, including their personal details, departments, and salaries. This project illustrates common DML operations such as inserting, retrieving, updating, and filtering data.

Table Creation

Create a table named Managers with the following fields:

- Manager_Id
- First_Name
- Last_Name
- DOB
- Age (with a CHECK constraint)
- Last_Update
- Gender
- Department
- Salary (NOT NULL)

Tasks

1) Insert 10 rows into the Managers table.

2) Write a query that retrieves the name and date of birth of the manager with Manager_Id = 1.

3) Write a query to display the annual income of all managers.

4) Write a query to display records of all managers except for the manager named ‘Aaliya’.

5) Write a query to display details of managers whose department is IT and who earn more than 25,000 per month.

6) Write a query to display details of managers whose salary is between 10,000 and 35,000.
